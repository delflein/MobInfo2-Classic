***     Classic Info       ***
******************************
I (TheRealHypo) took up this Addon from an earlier Version, that had already more
similarities with the Classic version of MobInfo2. Started to fix all Errors that
appeared while playing my first Classic characters. It's now in a playable State
and everytime a new Error comes up, I'll get to fixing it asap. 

I did not start this project, I do not claim to have written this code, while looking
through it, you'll notice a lot of people who have contributed to this project 
over the years.

Have Fun and Enjoy Classic ! Report any problems that appear in the Issues Panel. 

The below information is untouched by myself.

***     About MobInfo-2    ***
******************************
MobInfo-2 is a World of Warcraft AddOn that provides you with useful additional 
information about Mobs (ie. opponents/monsters). It adds new information to the 
game's Tooltip whenever you hover with your mouse over a mob. It also adds a 
numeric display of the Mobs health and mana (current and max) to the Mob target 
frame. MobInfo-2 is the continuation of the now abandoned "MobInfo" by Dizzarian 
combined with the original "MobHealth2" by Wyv. 

[[ IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS OF OTHER ADDONS:           ]]
[[ Please read the informatin in "ReadMe_MobInfo_API.txt" ! ]]


*****************************
***     MobInfo-2 Data    ***
*****************************
MobInfo collects data whenever you fight a Mob. It starts off with an empty 
database, which fills up automatically the more you fight and play. The data it 
collects is used for enhancing the game tooltip and the game target frame. It 
is also available to other AddOns (mostly the mob/target health values).

NEW FEATURE: The MobInfo database has become searchable. You can do a search 
for the 12 most profitable Mobs. You will find the "Search" button on the 
"Database" page of the options dialog.


******************************************
*** Extra Information For Game Tooltip ***
******************************************
The extra information available to show on the game tooltip is:

Class - class of mob
Health - current and total health of the mob
Mana - current and total mana of the mob
Damage - min/max damage range of Mob against you (stored per char)
DPS - your DPS (damage per second) against the Mob (stored per char)
-- Kills - number of times you have killed the mob (stored per char) -- Currently not working
Total Looted - number of times you have looted the mob
Empty Loots - number of times you found empty loot on the mob
XP - actual LAST xp amount you gained from the mob
# to Level - number of kills of this mob neede to gain a level
Quality - the quality of items that are dropped by the mob
Cloth drops - the number of times cloth has dropped on the mob
Avg Coin Drop - average amount of money dropped by the mob
Avg Item Value - average vendor value of items dropped by mob
Total Mob Value - total sum of avg coin drop and avg item value

Note that MobInfo offers a "Combined Mode" where the data of Mobs with the same name 
that only differ in level gets combined (added up) into one tooltip. This mode can be 
enabled through the options dialog


***************************************
*** Target Frame Health/Mana Values ***
***************************************
MobInfo can display the numeric and percentage values for your current targets health and 
mana right on the target frame (formerly known as MobHealth functionality). This display 
is highly configurable through the MobInfo options dialog (position, font, size, etc).


******************************
*** MobInfo Options Dialog ***
******************************
Type "/mi2" or "/mobinfo2" on the chat prompt to open the MobInfo options dialog. This 
dialog gives you full interactive control over EVERYTHING that MobInfo can do. All options 
take immediate effect. Simply try them all out. Decent defaults get set when you start 
MobInfo for the first time. Note that the 3 main categories "Tooltip", "Mob Health/Mana", 
and "Database Maintenance" have separate dedicated options pages within the options dialog.

Note that everything in the options dialog has an associated help text that explains to you 
what the option does. The help texts are shown automatically as a tooltip.


*******************************************
*** How to Backup your MobInfo database ***
*******************************************
It is very IMPORTANT to make occasional (even better: regular) backups of your MobInfo database. 
I have received several reports of users where due to whatever likely or unlikely incident the 
original MobInfo database got lost or erased or erased or currupted. It is unlikely and happens 
only very rarely, but when it happens your only chance to recover is to have a backup of the 
MobInfo database.

The entire MobInfo database is contained within this onr file:
   World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\<your_account_name>\SavedVariables\MobInfo.lua

First of all please logout of WoW. This automagically saves all current AddOn data to disk. Then 
make a copy of the database file (the one specified above) to a save location. To restore the 
backed up data simply copy the backup file back to the original location.

Side note: this is also the file that you must pass on if you want to give your MobInfo database 
to someone else. Which of course means it is also the file you receive when someone else gives you 
their MobInfo database.


**********************************************
*** IMPORT of an External MobInfo Database ***
**********************************************
MobInfo can import externally supplied MobInfo databases. This can be a 
database from a friend of yours or a database that you have downloaded 
somewhere. WARNING : the database that you import MUST be from someone who 
uses exactly the same WoW localization as you do (ie. the same WoW client 
language). Importing a MobInfo database rom someone using a different WoW 
language will NOT work and might destroy your own database.

First of all before importing data you should make a backup of your own 
database. This is explained above in the chapter "How to Backup your MobInfo 
database". It never hurts to be able to restore your original data in case 
you are unhappy with the import result. 

Here are the detailed import instructions:

1) Close your WoW client

2) Backup your MobInfo database as explained above

3) Rename the database file that you want to import from "MobInfo.lua" to "MI2_Import.lua"

4) Copy the file "MI2_Import.lua" into this folder:
   \World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\MobInfo\
   (that is the folder where the AddOn has been installed)

5) Start WoW and login with one of your chars

6) Open the MobInfo options (enter "/mi2" at the chat prompt) and go to the "Database" options 
   page. Near the bottom of the page you should now see whether the AddOn has found valid data 
   to be imported. If you did everything correctly the "Import" button should be clickable.

7) Choose whether you want to import only unknown Mobs, otherwise all Mobs will get imported. 
   If a Mob already exists in your database and you choose to import it the data of the new Mob 
   will get added to the data of the existing Mob. Now click the Import button to star the database 
   import operation. In your normal chat window you will see a summary of the import results.

8) Logout to cause WoW to save your now extended MobInfo database file. You should now delete the 
   file "MI2_Import.lua". It is no longer needed and it will waste memory as long as it exists.

TIP  : use the "import only unknown Mobs" if you know that there is a large amount of overlap between 
       your current database and the imported database. For instance if you import data from the same 
       source again (because he released a newer version).

TIP2 : You can also use this Import feature to import databases of the "MobHealth" AddOn. Use the 
       instructions exactly as listed above, but in step 2 rename "MobHealth.lua" (the MobHealth 
       database file from "savedvariables" folder) to "MI2_Import.lua".

******************************************************
** Where do the Mob health values come from ?
******************************************************
WoW itself does not allow AddOns to see the numeric health value of a Mob or 
other players. Instead WoW reports only a percentage value. To obtain a real 
maximum health value this value must be calculated, or more correctly 
approximated. That iss what MobInfo does. In order to do this you must fight 
the creature. During the fight the damage you do is reported as actual damage 
points. The current health of the Mob is reported as percentage values. From 
these values MobInfo calculates how much damage you are causing per percent 
change in health. The damage done per percent times 100 is the Mobs maximum health.

The method described above for approximating a Mobs health was first developed by "Telo" 
for his AddOn "MobHealth". It was then refined by "Wyv" for his own AddOn "MobHealth2". 
The MobInfo implementation stil is based on the same basic principle but uses a drastically 
improved mathematical approach.


******************************************************************
** How do I change tooltip position or tooltip popup behaviour ?
******************************************************************
MobInfo only adds information to the tooltip, but it does not modify where or how the tooltip appears. 
To change this there are a large number of real good tooltip controll AddOns available. I can't list 
them all here, but some of the better and more popular ones are: 
TipBuddy (http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=607), 
AF Tooltip Extreme (http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2416), 
or TooltipsKhaos (part of Cosmos compilation: http://www.cosmosui.org/).


******************************************************************
** Why is there a vendor sell value table in MobInfo ?
** What does MobInfo do with its vendor sell value table for items ?
******************************************************************
MobInfo has always had an excellent and very extensive built-in vendor sell value table. 
This table was used for calculating mob loot value. Otherwise MobInfo would be unable to 
know the value of the loot items found on a Mob.

As of MobInfo 3.20 I have added the option that you can also use the vendor sell value table 
for showing the vendor sell value of items in the item tooltip. You can enable this on the 
MobInfo tooltip options page. Since this simply (re)uses the table thats already there for 
a second good purposes it was an easy and neat little feature to add.

When compared to special price or item data collecting AddOns there is one disadvantage to 
the MobInfo solution. MobInfo does not update its table in game. Personally I do not consider 
this important or necessary because vendor prices in game are rather static and the table is 
very extensive (some 11.000 prices). In fact the table within MobInfo is a combination of the 
tables found in: Auctioneer, PriceMaster, and WoW-Econ.

About once every half year I update the MobInfo table with the most up-to-date prices and add 
vendor prices for new items that have been found.
